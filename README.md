Code for an add on for Google Sheets that'll notify on Flock on when a sheet of interest has been modded

#####Note: 
*This has been submitted to the add-on store and will be published soon for you use with any Google spreadsheet.*

####The sheet has the following limitations:

If the add on was installed from X domain, all editors outside X will show up as 'Anonymous'  in notifications
This has limited processing time available on Googles's servers and might stop working on excessive use. This limit isn't easy to reach
